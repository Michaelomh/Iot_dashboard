# Internet of Things (IoT) Dashboard
This Iot Dashboard is used in conjunction with SMU's Internet of Things (IS439) module. 
Our project aims to use Internet of things to help track shopping trollys and deter shopping trolleys from leaving the shopping mall premises.
This visualisation is created to be used by NTUC's managers to identify strategies to further deter shopping trolley misuse, and to predict peiods where many shopping trolleys are removed, etc.
